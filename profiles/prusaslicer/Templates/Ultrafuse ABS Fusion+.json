This special grade has been developed in collaboration with Polyscope Polymers - renowned for its material solutions in the automotive industry. ABS is a thermoplastic which is used in many applications. Although ABS has been classified as a standard material in 3D-printing it is known to be quite challenging to process. ABS Fusion+ combines the properties of ABS with an improved processability. The filament is based on an ABS grade which can be directly printed on glass without any adhesives or tape and has a higher success rate of prints due to extreme low warping.\"",
