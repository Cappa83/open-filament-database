## TODO: 
[ ] Rebuild closer to schemas so if they change it'd be almost automatic and not require rewriting parts of UI, Validation and backend
[ ] Add emojis and alt codes to illegal characters, should be reflected in /data_validator.py
[ ] Add slicer settings for filaments
[ ] Add hex_variants, color_standards for instances
[ ] Add image dimension validation to brand schema, got stuck in issues with what's available in browser vs server as all code needs to be available in both :/
[ ] Add python validation
[ ] Add export from zip option
