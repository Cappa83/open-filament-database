## TODO: 
[ ] Rebuild with less repetition in code
[ ] Rebuild closer to schemas so if they change it'd be almost automatic and not require rewriting parts of UI, Validation and backend
[ ] Use instanceVariantForm.svelte and instanceSizeForm.svekte in filamentVariantForm.svelte instead of replicating them almost exactly, might also be worht renaming filamentVariantForm.svelte to something like instanceForm.svelte
[ ] Add emojis and alt codes to illegal characters, should be reflected in /data_validator.py
[ ] add slicer settings for filaments
[ ] add hex_variants, color_standards for instances
